## 🎨 Installation

You can install Ashen with Yazi's package manager:

```bash
ya pkg add ficd0/ashen:ashen
```

Alternatively, download the `ashen.yazi` folder and place it inside
`~/.config/yazi/flavors/`.

## ⚙️ Usage

To set it as your dark flavor, change the content of your `theme.toml` to:

```toml
[flavor]
dark = "ashen"
```

Make sure your `theme.toml` doesn't contain anything other than `[flavor]`,
unless you want to override certain styles of this flavor.

See the
[Yazi flavor documentation](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/flavors/overview) for
more details.
