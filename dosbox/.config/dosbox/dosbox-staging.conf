#             display: Number of display to use; values depend on OS and user settings (0 by default).
#      fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: 'original', 'desktop'
#                      or a fixed size, e.g. 1024x768 ('desktop' by default).
#    windowresolution: Set window size when running in windowed mode:
#                        default:   Select the best option based on your environment and

#                        small, medium, large (s, m, l):
#                                   Size the window relative to the desktop.
#                        <custom>:  Scale the window to the given dimensions in WxH format.
#                                   For example: 1024x768.
#                                   Scaling is not performed for output=surface.
# viewport_resolution: Set the viewport size (drawable area) within the window/screen:
#                        fit:       Fit the viewport to the available window/screen (default).

#                        auto:      Use SDI rates, or VRR rates when fullscreen on a high-refresh
#                                   display (default).
#                        sdi:       Use serial device interface (SDI) rates, without further
#                                   adjustment.
#                        vrr:       Deduct 3 Hz from the reported rate (best-practice for VRR
#                                   displays).
#                        <custom>:  Specify a custom rate as a whole or decimal value greater than
#                                   23.000.
#               vsync: Synchronize with display refresh rate if supported to eliminate flickering
#                      and tearing (enabled by default).
#          vsync_skip: Number of microseconds to allow rendering to block before skipping the
#                      next frame (7000 by default). 0 disables this and will always render.

#                               stalls, based on host and DOS frame rates (default).
#                        cfr:   Always present DOS frames at a constant frame rate.
#                        vfr:   Always present changed DOS frames at a variable frame rate.
#                      Possible values: auto, cfr, vfr.

#    texture_renderer: Render driver to use in 'texture' output mode ('auto' by default).
#                      Use 'texture_renderer = auto' for an automatic choice.
#                      Possible values: auto, opengl, opengles2, software.
#         waitonerror: Keep the console open if an error has occurred (enabled by default).
#            priority: Priority levels to apply when active and inactive, respectively.
#                      ('auto auto' by default)
#                      'auto' lets the host operating system manage the priority.
#                      Possible values: auto, lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest.
#  mute_when_inactive: Mute the sound when the window is inactive (disabled by default).
# pause_when_inactive: Pause emulation when the window is inactive (disabled by default).
#          mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings.
#                      Pre-configured maps are bundled in the 'resources/mapperfiles' directory.
#                      They can be loaded by name, for example: mapperfile = xbox/xenon2.map
#                      Notes: The -resetmapper commandline flag only deletes the default mapperfile.
#         screensaver: Use 'allow' or 'block' to override the SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER environment
#                      variable which usually blocks the OS screensaver while the emulator is
#                      running ('auto' by default).
#                      Possible values: auto, allow, block.

#                                     feature.
#                     machine: The type of machine DOSBox tries to emulate ('svga_s3' by default).
#                              Possible values: hercules, cga, cga_mono, tandy, pcjr, ega, svga_s3, svga_et3000, svga_et4000, svga_paradise, vesa_nolfb, vesa_oldvbe.

#                     memsize: Amount of memory of the emulated machine has in MB (16 by default).
#                              Best leave at the default setting to avoid problems with some games,
#                              though a few games might require a higher value.
#                              There is generally no speed advantage when raising this value.
#          mcb_fault_strategy: How software-corrupted memory chain blocks should be handled:
#                                deny:    Quit (and report) when faults are detected (default).
#                                repair:  Repair (and report) faults using adjacent chain blocks.
#                                report:  Report faults but otherwise proceed as-is.
#                                allow:   Allow faults to go unreported (hardware behavior).
#                              The default ('deny') is recommended unless a game is failing with MCB
#                              corruption errors.
#                              Possible values: deny, repair, report, allow.
#                    vmemsize: Video memory in MB (1-8) or KB (256 to 8192). 'auto' uses the default per
#                              video adapter ('auto' by default).
#                              Possible values: auto, 1, 2, 4, 8, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192.
#                    dos_rate: Customize the emulated video mode's frame rate, in Hz:
#                                default:  The DOS video mode determines the rate (recommended; default).
#                                host:     Match the DOS rate to the host rate (see 'host_rate' setting).
#                                <value>:  Sets the rate to an exact value, between 24.000 and 1000.000 (Hz).
#                              We recommend the 'default' rate; otherwise test and set on a per-game basis.
#                  vesa_modes: Controls the selection of VESA 1.2 and 2.0 modes offered:
#                                compatible:  A tailored selection that maximizes game compatibility.
#                                             This is recommended along with 4 or 8 MB of video memory
#                                             (default).
#                                halfline:    Supports the low-resolution halfline VESA 2.0 mode used by
#                                             Extreme Assault. Use only if needed, as it's not S3 compatible.
#                                all:         Offers all modes for a given video memory size, however
#                                             some games may not use them properly (flickering) or may need
#                                             more system memory to use them.
#                              Possible values: compatible, all, halfline.
#                  speed_mods: Permit changes known to improve performance (enabled by default).
#                              Currently, no games are known to be negatively affected by this.
#                              Please file a bug with the project if you find a game that fails
#                              when this is enabled so we will list them here.
#            autoexec_section: How autoexec sections are handled from multiple config files:
#                                join:       Combine them into one big section (legacy behavior; default).
#                                overwrite:  Use the last one encountered, like other config settings.
#                              Possible values: join, overwrite.
#                   automount: Mount 'drives/[c]' directories as drives on startup, where [c] is a lower-case
#                              drive letter from 'a' to 'y' (enabled by default). The 'drives' folder can be
#                              provided relative to the current directory or via built-in resources.
#                              Mount settings can be optionally provided using a [c].conf file along-side
#                              the drive's directory, with content as follows:
#                                [drive]
#                                type    = dir, overlay, floppy, or cdrom

#                                override_drive = mount the directory to this drive instead (default empty)
#                                verbose = true or false
#           startup_verbosity: Controls verbosity prior to displaying the program ('auto' by default):
#                                Verbosity   | Welcome | Early stdout
#                                high        |   yes   |    yes
#                                low         |   no    |    yes
#                                quiet       |   no    |    no
#                                auto        | 'low' if exec or dir is passed, otherwise 'high'
#                              Possible values: auto, high, low, quiet.
# allow_write_protected_files: Many games open all their files with writable permissions; even files that they
#                              never modify. This setting lets you write-protect those files while still
#                              allowing the game to read them. A second use-case: if you're using a copy-on-write
#                              or network-based filesystem, this setting avoids triggering write-operations for
#                              these write-protected files.

#             aspect: Scale the vertical resolution to produce a 4:3 display aspect ratio, matching
#                     that of the original monitors the majority of DOS games were designed for
#                     (enabled by default).
#                     This setting only affects video modes that use non-square pixels, such as
#                     320x200 or 640x400; whereas square-pixel modes, such as 640x480
#                     and 800x600, are displayed as-is.
# monochrome_palette: Select default palette for monochrome display ('white' by default).
#                     Works only when emulating 'hercules' or 'cga_mono'.

#                                      (default).
#                       tandy <bl>:    Emulation of an idealised Tandy monitor with adjustable brown
#                                      level. The brown level can be provided as an optional second
#                                      parameter (0 - red, 50 - brown, 100 - dark yellow;
#                                      defaults to 50). E.g. tandy 100
#                       tandy-warm:    Emulation of the actual colour output of an unknown Tandy

#                     You can also set custom colours by specifying 16 space or comma separated
#                     colour values, either as 3 or 6-digit hex codes (e.g. #f00 or #ff0000 for full red),
#                     or decimal RGB triplets (e.g. (255, 0, 255) for magenta). The 16 colours are

#                     command-line argument, or an absolute or relative path to a file.
#                     'default' sets the `interpolation/sharp.glsl` shader.

#              Notes: Fine-tune the settings below (i.e., hue) using the composite hotkeys,
#                     then read the new settings from your console and enter them here.
#              Possible values: auto, on, off.
#         era: Era of composite technology ('auto' by default).
#              When 'auto', PCjr uses 'new', and CGA/Tandy use 'old'.
#              Possible values: auto, old, new.
#         hue: Appearance of RGB palette. For example, adjust until the sky is blue.
#  saturation: Intensity of colors, from washed out to vivid.
#    contrast: Ratio between the dark and light area.
#  brightness: Luminosity of the image, from dark to light.
# convergence: Convergence of subpixel elements, from blurry to sharp (CGA and Tandy-only).

[cpu]
#      core: CPU core used in emulation ('auto' by default). 'auto' will switch to dynamic
#            if available and appropriate.
#            Possible values: auto, dynamic, normal, simple.
#   cputype: CPU type used in emulation ('auto' by default). 'auto' is the fastest choice.
#            Possible values: auto, 386, 386_slow, 486_slow, pentium_slow, 386_prefetch.
#    cycles: Number of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate per millisecond
#            ('auto' by default). Setting this value too high may result in sound drop-outs
#            and lags.
#            Possible settings:
#              auto:            Try to guess what a game needs. It usually works, but can
#                               fail with certain games.
#              fixed <number>:  Set a fixed number of cycles. This is what you usually
#                               need if 'auto' fails (e.g. 'fixed 4000').
#              max:             Allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to handle.
#            Possible values: auto, fixed, max.
#   cycleup: Number of cycles added or subtracted with speed control hotkeys
#            (10 by default).
# cycledown: Setting it lower than 100 will be a percentage (20 by default).

[mouse]
#             mouse_capture: Set the mouse capture behaviour:
#                              onclick:   Capture the mouse when clicking any mouse button in the window 
#                                         (default).
#                              onstart:   Capture the mouse immediately on start. Might not work correctly
#                                         on some host operating systems.
#                              seamless:  Let the mouse move seamlessly between the DOSBox window and the
#                                         rest of the desktop; captures only with middle-click or hotkey.
#                                         Seamless mouse does not work correctly with all the games.
#                                         Windows 3.1x can be made compatible with a custom mouse driver.
#                              nomouse:   Hide the mouse and don't send mouse input to the game.
#                            For touch-screen control, use 'seamless'.
#                            Possible values: seamless, onclick, onstart, nomouse.
#      mouse_middle_release: If enabled, middle-click will release the captured mouse, and also capture
#                            when seamless (enabled by default).
# mouse_multi_display_aware: Allows mouse seamless behavior and mouse pointer release to work in fullscreen
#                            mode for systems with more than one display. (enabled by default).
#                            Notes: You should set this to false if it incorrectly detects multiple displays
#                                   when only one should actually be used. This might happen if you are
#                                   using mirrored display mode or using an AV receiver's HDMI input for
#                                   audio-only listening.
#         mouse_sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity for the horizontal and vertical axes, as a percentage
#                            (100,100 by default). Negative values invert the axis, zero disables it.
#                            Providing only one value sets sensitivity for both axes.
#                            The setting can be adjusted in runtime (also per mouse interface) using
#                            internal MOUSECTL.COM tool, available on drive Z.
#           mouse_raw_input: Enable to bypass your operating system's mouse acceleration and sensitivity
#                            settings (enabled by default). Works in fullscreen or when the mouse is
#                            captured in window mode.
#          dos_mouse_driver: Enable built-in DOS mouse driver (enabled by default).
#                            Notes: Disable if you intend to use original MOUSE.COM driver in emulated DOS.
#                                   When guest OS is booted, built-in driver gets disabled automatically.
#       dos_mouse_immediate: Update mouse movement counters immediately, without waiting for interrupt
#                            (disabled by default). May improve gameplay, especially in fast-paced games
#                            (arcade, FPS, etc.), as for some games it effectively boosts the mouse
#                            sampling rate to 1000 Hz, without increasing interrupt overhead.
#                            Might cause compatibility issues. List of known incompatible games:
#                              - Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss

[mixer]
#    nosound: Enable silent mode (disabled by default).
#             Sound is still fully emulated in silent mode, but DOSBox outputs silence.
#       rate: Mixer sample rate (48000 by default).
#             Possible values: 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 32000, 44100, 48000.
#  blocksize: Mixer block size; larger values might help with sound stuttering but sound will
#             also be more lagged.
#             Possible values: 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192.
#  prebuffer: How many milliseconds of sound to render on top of the blocksize; larger values
#             might help with sound stuttering but sound will also be more lagged.
#  negotiate: Let the system audio driver negotiate (possibly) better rate and blocksize
#             settings.
# compressor: Enable the auto-leveling compressor on the master channel to prevent clipping
#             of the audio output:
#               off:  Disable compressor.
#               on:   Enable compressor (default).
#  crossfeed: Set crossfeed globally on all stereo channels for headphone listening:
#               off:         No crossfeed (default).
#               on:          Enable crossfeed (at strength 40).
#               <strength>:  Set crossfeed strength from 0 to 100, where 0 means no crossfeed
#                            (off) and 100 full crossfeed (effectively turning stereo content
#                            into mono).
#             Notes: You can set per-channel crossfeed via mixer commands.
#     reverb: Enable reverb globally to add a sense of space to the sound:
#               off:     No reverb (default).
#               on:      Enable reverb (medium preset).
#               tiny:    Simulates the sound of a small integrated speaker in a room;
#                        specifically designed for small-speaker audio systems
#                        (PC Speaker, Tandy, PS/1 Audio, and LPT DAC devices).
#               small:   Adds a subtle sense of space; good for games that use a single
#                        synth channel (typically OPL) for both music and sound effects.
#               medium:  Medium room preset that works well with a wide variety of games.
#               large:   Large hall preset recommended for games that use separate
#                        channels for music and digital audio.
#               huge:    A stronger variant of the large hall preset; works really well
#                        in some games with more atmospheric soundtracks.
#             Notes: You can fine-tune per-channel reverb levels via mixer commands.
#             Possible values: off, on, tiny, small, medium, large, huge.
#     chorus: Enable chorus globally to add a sense of stereo movement to the sound:
#               off:     No chorus (default).
#               on:      Enable chorus (normal preset).
#               light:   A light chorus effect (especially suited for synth music that
#                        features lots of white noise.)
#               normal:  Normal chorus that works well with a wide variety of games.
#               strong:  An obvious and upfront chorus effect.
#             Notes: You can fine-tune per-channel chorus levels via mixer commands.
#             Possible values: off, on, light, normal, strong.

[midi]
#      mididevice: Set where MIDI data from the emulated MPU-401 MIDI interface is sent
#                  ('auto' by default):
#                    oss:         Use the Linux OSS MIDI playback interface.
#                    alsa:        Use the Linux ALSA MIDI playback interface.
#                    fluidsynth:  The built-in FluidSynth MIDI synthesizer (SoundFont player).
#                                 See the [fluidsynth] section for detailed configuration.
#                    mt32:        The built-in Roland MT-32 synthesizer.
#                                 See the [mt32] section for detailed configuration.
#                    auto:        Either one of the built-in MIDI synthesisers (if `midiconfig` is
#                                 set to 'fluidsynth' or 'mt32'), or a MIDI device external to
#                                 DOSBox (any other 'midiconfig' value). This might be a software
#                                 synthesizer or physical device. This is the default behaviour.
#                    none:        Disable MIDI output.
#                  Possible values: auto, oss, alsa, fluidsynth, mt32, none.
#      midiconfig: Configuration options for the selected MIDI interface (unset by default).
#                  This is usually the ID or name of the MIDI synthesizer you want
#                  to use (find the ID/name with the DOS command 'MIXER /LISTMIDI').
#                  Notes: - This option has no effect when using the built-in synthesizers
#                           ('mididevice = fluidsynth' or 'mididevice = mt32').
#                         - When using ALSA, use the Linux command 'aconnect -l' to list all open
#                           MIDI ports and select one (e.g. 'midiconfig = 14:0' for sequencer
#                           client 14, port 0).
#                         - If you're using a physical Roland MT-32 with revision 0 PCB, the
#                           hardware may require a delay in order to prevent its buffer from
#                           overflowing. In that case, add 'delaysysex', e.g:
#                           'midiconfig = 2 delaysysex'.
#          mpu401: MPU-401 mode to emulate ('intelligent' by default).
#                  Possible values: intelligent, uart, none.
# raw_midi_output: Enable raw, unaltered MIDI output (disabled by default).
#                  The MIDI drivers of many games don't fully conform to the MIDI standard,
#                  which makes editing the MIDI recordings of these games very error-prone and
#                  cumbersome in MIDI sequencers, often resulting in hanging or missing notes.
#                  DOSBox corrects the MIDI output of such games by default. This results in no
#                  audible difference whatsoever; it only affects the representation of the MIDI
#                  data. You should only enable 'raw_midi_output' if you really need to capture
#                  the raw, unaltered MIDI output of a program, e.g. when working with music
#                  applications, or when debugging MIDI issues.

[fluidsynth]
#     soundfont: Path to a SoundFont file in .sf2 format ('default.sf2' by default).
#                You can use an absolute or relative path, or the name of an .sf2 inside the
#                'soundfonts' directory within your DOSBox configuration directory.
#                Notes: The optional volume scaling percentage after the filename has been
#                       deprecated. Please use a mixer command instead to change the FluidSynth
#                       audio channel's volume, e.g. 'MIXER FSYNTH 200'
# fsynth_chorus: Chorus effect: 'auto' (default), 'on', 'off', or custom values.
#                When using custom values:
#                  All five must be provided in-order and space-separated.
#                  They are: voice-count level speed depth modulation-wave, where:
#                    - voice-count is an integer from 0 to 99.
#                    - level is a decimal from 0.0 to 10.0
#                    - speed is a decimal, measured in Hz, from 0.1 to 5.0
#                    - depth is a decimal from 0.0 to 21.0
#                    - modulation-wave is either 'sine' or 'triangle'
#                  For example: chorus = 3 1.2 0.3 8.0 sine
#                Notes: You can disable the FluidSynth chorus and enable the mixer-level chorus
#                       on the FluidSynth channel instead, or enable both chorus effects at the
#                       same time. Whether this sounds good depends on the SoundFont and the
#                       chorus settings being used.
# fsynth_reverb: Reverb effect: 'auto' (default), 'on', 'off', or custom values.
#                When using custom values:
#                  All four must be provided in-order and space-separated.
#                  They are: room-size damping width level, where:
#                    - room-size is a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
#                    - damping is a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
#                    - width is a decimal from 0.0 to 100.0

#                                - Ctrl/Cmd+Arrow-keys adjusts the axis' scalar value:
#                                    - left and right diminish or magnify the x-axis scalar, respectively.
#                                    - down and up diminish or magnify the y-axis scalar, respectively.
#                                - Alt+Arrow-keys adjusts the axis' offset position:
#                                    - left and right shift x-axis offset in the given direction.
#                                    - down and up shift the y-axis offset in the given direction.
#                                - Reset the X and Y calibration using Ctrl+Delete and Ctrl+Home,
#                                  respectively.
#                              Each tap will report X or Y calibration values you can set below. When you find
#                              parameters that work, quit the game, switch this setting back to false, and

#            ne2000: Enable emulation of a Novell NE2000 network card on a software-based
#                    network (using libslirp) with properties as follows (enabled by default):
#                      - 255.255.255.0:  Subnet mask of the 10.0.2.0 virtual LAN.
#                      - 10.0.2.2:       IP of the gateway and DHCP service.
#                      - 10.0.2.3:       IP of the virtual DNS server.
#                      - 10.0.2.15:      First IP provided by DHCP, your IP!
#                    Notes: Inside DOS, setting this up requires an NE2000 packet driver, DHCP
#                           client, and TCP/IP stack. You might need port-forwarding from the host
#                           into the DOS guest, and from your router to your host when acting as the
#                           server for multiplayer games.
#           nicbase: Base address of the NE2000 card (300 by default).
#                    Notes: Addresses 220 and 240 might not be available as they're assigned to the
#                           Sound Blaster and Gravis UltraSound by default.
#                    Possible values: 200, 220, 240, 260, 280, 2c0, 300, 320, 340, 360.
#            nicirq: The interrupt used by the NE2000 card (3 by default).
#                    Notes: IRQs 3 and 5 might not be available as they're assigned to
#                           'serial2' and the Gravis UltraSound by default.
#                    Possible values: 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15.
#           macaddr: The MAC address of the NE2000 card ('AC:DE:48:88:99:AA' by default).
# tcp_port_forwards: Forward one or more TCP ports from the host into the DOS guest
#                    (unset by default).
#                    The format is:
#                      port1  port2  port3 ... (e.g., 21 80 443)
#                      This will forward FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS into the DOS guest.
#                    If the ports are privileged on the host, a mapping can be used
#                      host:guest  ..., (e.g., 8021:21 8080:80)
#                      This will forward ports 8021 and 8080 to FTP and HTTP in the guest
#                    A range of adjacent ports can be abbreviated with a dash:
#                      start-end ... (e.g., 27910-27960)
#                      This will forward ports 27910 to 27960 into the DOS guest.
#                    Mappings and ranges can be combined, too:
#                      hstart-hend:gstart-gend ..., (e.g, 8040-8080:20-60)
#                      This forwards ports 8040 to 8080 into 20 to 60 in the guest
#                    Notes: If mapped ranges differ, the shorter range is extended to fit.
#                           If conflicting host ports are given, only the first one is setup.
#                           If conflicting guest ports are given, the latter rule takes precedent.
# udp_port_forwards: Forward one or more UDP ports from the host into the DOS guest
#                    (unset by default). The format is the same as for TCP port forwards.
